a sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same for example these are arithmetic sequences the following sequence is not arithmetic a zero indexed array a consisting of n numbers is given a subsequence slice of that array is any sequence of integers p p pk such that le p p pk n a subsequence slice p p pk of array a is called arithmetic if the sequence a p a p a pk a pk is arithmetic in particular this means that k ge the function should return the number of arithmetic subsequence slices in the array a the input contains n integers every integer is in the range of and and le n le the output is guaranteed to be less than example input output explanation all arithmetic subsequence slices are
you have types of lego blocks of sizes given as x x x x x x and x x assume that you have an infinite number of blocks of each type using these blocks you want to make a wall of height n and width m the wall should not have any holes in it the wall you build should be one solid structure a solid structure can be interpreted in one of the following ways it should not be possible to separate the wall along any vertical line without cutting any lego block used to build the wall you cannot make a vertical cut from top to bottom without cutting one or more lego blocks the blocks can only be placed horizontally in how many ways can the wall be built    
there are pairs of hard disk drives hdds in a cluster each hdd is located at an integer coordinate on an infinite straight line and each pair consists of one primary hdd and one backup hdd next you want to place computers at integer coordinates on the same infinite straight line each pair of hdds must then be connected to a single computer via wires but a computer can have any number even zero of hdds connected to it the length of a wire connecting a single hdd to a computer is the absolute value of the distance between their respective coordinates on the infinite line we consider the total length of wire used to connect all the hdds to computers to be the sum of the lengths of all the wires used to connect hdds to computers note that both the primary and secondary hdds in a pair must connect to the same computer given the locations of pairs i e primary and backup of hdds and the value of place all computers in such a way that the total length of wire needed to connect each pair of hdds to computers is minimal then print the total length on a new line

it is the indian version of the famous heist “the italian job” n robbers have already broken into the national museum and are just about to get inside the main vault which is full of jewels they were lucky that just as they broke into the museum the guard was leaving the museum for exactly g minutes but there are other problems too the main vault has heat sensors that if at any moment of time there are more than two people present in the vault the alarm goes off to collect the jewels the ith robber needs to be inside the vault for exactly a i minutes i n in one continuous stretch as guard will return after g minutes they have to finish their tasks within g minutes the robbers want to know if there exists any arrangement such that demands of each robber is satisfied and also they are not caught    
clone an undirected graph each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors oj's undirected graph serialization nodes are labeled uniquely we use as a separator for each node and as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node as an example consider the serialized graph the graph has a total of three nodes and therefore contains three parts as separated by first node is labeled as connect node to both nodes and second node is labeled as connect node to node third node is labeled as connect node to node itself thus forming a self cycle visually the graph looks like the following

superman has been invited to india to celebrate diwali unfortunately on his arrival he learns that he has been invited mainly to help rescue people from a fire accident that has happened in a posh residential locale of new delhi where rescue is proving to be especially difficult as he reaches the place of the fire before him there are buildings each of the same height which are on fire since it is diwali some floors of the buildings are empty as the occupants have gone elsewhere for celebrations in his hurry to start the rescue superman reaches the top of the building but realizes that his jumping power is depleted and restricted due to change in his geographical setting he soon understands the restrictions of his jumping power and they are as follows he can use the jumping power any number of times until he reaches the bottom floor which means he can use the jumping power only until before he reaches the bottom ground floor which means once he reaches the bottom floor he cannot move to the top floor again and try to save people in one single drop from the top to bottom while switching buildings he loses height while jumping the second restriction is explained below with an example assume now superman is in the nd building th floor if he wants to switch to the fifth building he will lose height which means he will be at floor at building he can jump freely from the current floor to the floor below on the same building that is suppose if he is at he can go to without any restrictions he cannot skip a floor while jumping in the same building he can go to the floor below the current floor of the same building or use his jumping power switch building and lose height given the information about the occupied floors in each of the buildings help superman to determine the maximum number of people he can save in one single drop from the top to the bottom floor with the given restrictions

shaka and his brother have created a boring game which is played like this they take a word composed of lowercase english letters and try to get the maximum possible score by building exactly palindromic subsequences the score obtained is the product of the length of these subsequences let's say and are two subsequences from the initial string if are the smallest and the largest positions from the initial word respectively in and are the smallest and the largest positions from the initial word respectively in then the following statements hold true i e the positions of the subsequences should not cross over each other hence the score obtained is the product of lengths of subsequences such subsequences can be numerous for a larger initial word and hence it becomes harder to find out the maximum possible score can you help shaka and his brother find this out
