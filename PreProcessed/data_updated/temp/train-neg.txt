in the middle of a nightmare maxine suddenly finds herself in a mysterious room with the following items a piece of paper with the word score and the integer written on it a map of the castle where the room is located there are rooms uniquely labeled from to there are bidirectional corridors connecting pairs of rooms the value of score changes every time she travels up or down a corridor and this value differs depending on her direction of travel along the corridor each corridor can be traveled any number of times in either direction every room is reachable from every other room maxine is located in the room labeled the exit is located in the room labeled once this room is reached score is reduced modulo and maxine can but is not required to exit that level assume some corridor where is associated with an integer and connects rooms and then traveling corridor from room to room increases score by traveling corridor from room to room decreases score by there are levels to maxine's nightmare castle and each one has a different set of values for and given the above information help maxine by finding and printing her maximum possible score for each level only you can help her wake up from this nightmare note recall that the result of a modulo operation is always non negative for example    
there are a number of spherical balloons spread in two dimensional space for each balloon provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter since it's horizontal y coordinates don't matter and hence the x coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice start is always smaller than end there will be at most balloons an arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x axis a balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart le x le xend there is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot an arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely the problem is to find the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons example input output explanation one way is to shoot one arrow for example at x bursting the balloons and and another arrow at x bursting the other two balloons

nikita is making a graph as a birthday gift for her boyfriend a fellow programmer she drew an undirected connected graph with nodes numbered from to in her notebook each node is shaded in either white or black we define to be the number of white nodes and to be the number of black nodes the graph is drawn in such a way that no adjacent nodes have same coloring the value of which we'll call is minimal nikita's mischievous little brother erased some of the edges and all of the coloring from her graph as a result the graph is now decomposed into one or more components because you're her best friend you've decided to help her reconstruct the graph by adding edges such that the aforementioned graph properties hold true given the decomposed graph construct and shade a valid connected graph such that the difference between its shaded nodes is minimal

a frog is crossing a river the river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a stone the frog can jump on a stone but it must not jump into the water given a list of stones' positions in units in sorted ascending order determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone initially the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be unit if the frog's last jump was k units then its next jump must be either k k or k units note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction note the number of stones is ge and is each stone's position will be a non negative integer the first stone's position is always example there are a total of stones the first stone at the th unit second stone at the st unit third stone at the rd unit and so on the last stone at the th unit return true the frog can jump to the last stone by jumping unit to the nd stone then units to the rd stone then units to the th stone then units to the th stone units to the th stone and units to the th stone example return false there is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the th and th stone is too large
divide and conquer on a tree is a powerful approach to solving tree problems imagine a tree with vertices let's remove some vertex from tree splitting into zero or more connected components with vertices we can prove that there is a vertex such that the size of each formed components is at most the divide and conquer approach can be described as follows initially there is a tree with vertices find vertex such that if is removed from the tree the size of each formed component after removing is at most remove from tree perform this approach recursively for each of the connected components we can prove that if we find such a vertex in linear time e g using dfs the entire approach works in of course sometimes there are several such vertices that we can choose on some step we can take and remove any of them however right now we are interested in trees such that at each step there is a unique vertex that we can choose given count the number of tree 's such that the divide and conquer approach works determinately on them as this number can be quite large your answer must be modulo    
write a program to find the n th ugly number ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include for example is the sequence of the first ugly numbers note that is typically treated as an ugly number and n does not exceed the naive approach is to call isugly for every number until you reach the nth one most numbers are not ugly try to focus your effort on generating only the ugly ones an ugly number must be multiplied by either or from a smaller ugly number the key is how to maintain the order of the ugly numbers try a similar approach of merging from three sorted lists l l and l assume you have uk the kth ugly number then uk must be min l l l credits special thanks to jianchao li fighter for adding this problem and creating all test cases

we are playing the guess game the game is as follows i pick a number from to n you have to guess which number i picked every time you guess wrong i'll tell you whether the number i picked is higher or lower however when you guess a particular number x and you guess wrong you pay x you win the game when you guess the number i picked example n i pick first round you guess i tell you that it's higher you pay second round you guess i tell you that it's higher you pay third round you guess i tell you that it's lower you pay game over is the number i picked you end up paying given a particular n ge find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win the best strategy to play the game is to minimize the maximum loss you could possibly face another strategy is to minimize the expected loss here we are interested in the first scenario take a small example n what do you end up paying in the worst case check out this article if you're still stuck the purely recursive implementation of minimax would be worthless for even a small n you must use dynamic programming as a follow up how would you modify your code to solve the problem of minimizing the expected loss instead of the worst case loss credits special thanks to agave and stefanpochmann for adding this problem and creating all test cases
