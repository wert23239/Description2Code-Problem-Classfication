given a non empty array containing only positive integers find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal note each of the array element will not exceed the array size will not exceed example input output true explanation the array can be partitioned as and example input output false explanation the array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets
define s s n as the string s which consists of n connected strings s for example abc abcabcabc on the other hand we define that string s can be obtained from string s if we can remove some characters from s such that it becomes s for example “abc” can be obtained from “abdbec” based on our definition but it can not be obtained from “acbbe” you are given two non empty strings s and s each at most characters long and two integers le n le and le n le now consider the strings s and s where s s n and s s n find the maximum integer m such that s m can be obtained from s example input s acb n s ab n return

suppose leetcode will start its ipo soon in order to sell a good price of its shares to venture capital leetcode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the ipo since it has limited resources it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the ipo help leetcode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects you are given several projects for each project i it has a pure profit pi and a minimum capital of ci is needed to start the corresponding project initially you have w capital when you finish a project you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital to sum up pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital and output your final maximized capital example input k w profits capital output explanation since your initial capital is you can only start the project indexed after finishing it you will obtain profit and your capital becomes with capital you can either start the project indexed or the project indexed since you can choose at most projects you need to finish the project indexed to get the maximum capital therefore output the final maximized capital which is note you may assume all numbers in the input are non negative integers the length of profits array and capital array will not exceed the answer is guaranteed to fit in a bit signed integer

given a non negative integer number num for every numbers i in the range le i le num calculate the number of 's in their binary representation and return them as an array example for num you should return follow up it is very easy to come up with a solution with run time o n sizeof integer but can you do it in linear time o n possibly in a single pass? space complexity should be o n can you do it like a boss? do it without using any builtin function like builtin popcount in c or in any other language you should make use of what you have produced already divide the numbers in ranges like and so on and try to generate new range from previous or does the odd even status of the number help you in calculating the number of s? credits special thanks to syedee for adding this problem and creating all test cases

given an array of citations each citation is a non negative integer of a researcher write a function to compute the researcher's h index according to the definition of h index on wikipedia a scientist has index h if h of his her n papers have at least h citations each and the other n − h papers have no more than h citations each for example given citations which means the researcher has papers in total and each of them had received citations respectively since the researcher has papers with at least citations each and the remaining two with no more than citations each his h index is note if there are several possible values for h the maximum one is taken as the h index an easy approach is to sort the array first what are the possible values of h index? a faster approach is to use extra space credits special thanks to jianchao li fighter for adding this problem and creating all test cases

we are playing the guess game the game is as follows i pick a number from to n you have to guess which number i picked every time you guess wrong i'll tell you whether the number i picked is higher or lower however when you guess a particular number x and you guess wrong you pay x you win the game when you guess the number i picked example n i pick first round you guess i tell you that it's higher you pay second round you guess i tell you that it's higher you pay third round you guess i tell you that it's lower you pay game over is the number i picked you end up paying given a particular n ge find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win the best strategy to play the game is to minimize the maximum loss you could possibly face another strategy is to minimize the expected loss here we are interested in the first scenario take a small example n what do you end up paying in the worst case? check out this article if you're still stuck the purely recursive implementation of minimax would be worthless for even a small n you must use dynamic programming as a follow up how would you modify your code to solve the problem of minimizing the expected loss instead of the worst case loss? credits special thanks to agave and stefanpochmann for adding this problem and creating all test cases

in the video game fallout the quest road to freedom requires players to reach a metal dial called the freedom trail ring and use the dial to spell a specific keyword in order to open the door given a string ring which represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string key which represents the keyword needs to be spelled you need to find the minimum number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword initially the first character of the ring is aligned at direction you need to spell all the characters in the string key one by one by rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at direction and then by pressing the center button at the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key i you can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise one place which counts as step the final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string ring's characters at the direction where this character must equal to the character key i if the character key i has been aligned at the direction you need to press the center button to spell which also counts as step after the pressing you could begin to spell the next character in the key next stage otherwise you've finished all the spelling example input ring godding key gd output explanation for the first key character 'g' since it is already in place we just need step to spell this character for the second key character 'd' we need to rotate the ring godding anticlockwise by two steps to make it become ddinggo also we need more step for spelling so the final output is note length of both ring and key will be in range to there are only lowercase letters in both strings and might be some duplcate characters in both strings it's guaranteed that string key could always be spelled by rotating the string ring
