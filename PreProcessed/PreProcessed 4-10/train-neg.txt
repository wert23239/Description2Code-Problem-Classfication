samantha and sam are playing a game they have n balls in front of them each ball numbered from to except the first ball which is numbered from to samantha calculates all the sub strings of the number thus formed one by one if the sub string is s sam has to throw s candies into an initially empty box at the end of the game sam has to find out the total number of candies in the box t as t can be large samantha asks sam to tell t instead if sam answers correctly he can keep all the candies sam can t take all this maths and asks for your help help him    
in the game two players take turns adding to a running total any integer from the player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed wins what if we change the game so that players cannot re use integers for example two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers of without replacement until they reach a total given an integer maxchoosableinteger and another integer desiredtotal determine if the first player to move can force a win assuming both players play optimally you can always assume that maxchoosableinteger will not be larger than and desiredtotal will not be larger than example input maxchoosableinteger desiredtotal output false explanation no matter which integer the first player choose the first player will lose the first player can choose an integer from up to if the first player choose the second player can only choose integers from up to the second player will win by choosing and get a total which is desiredtotal same with other integers chosen by the first player the second player will always win

a string is called a square string if it can be obtained by concatenating two copies of the same string for example abab aa are square strings while aaa abba are not given a string how many non empty subsequences of the string are square strings a subsequence of a string can be obtained by deleting zero or more characters from it and maintaining the relative order of the remaining characters    
roy is helping the police department of his city in crime fighting today they informed him about a new planned operation think of the city as a plane the road along the axis is very crime prone because criminals live there no two criminals live at the same position to catch these criminals the police department has to recruit some police officers and give each of them usd as wages a police officer can start his operation from any point drive his car to point in a straight line and catch all the criminals who live on this way the cost of fuel used by the officer s car is equal to the square of the euclidean distance between points and euclidean distance between points and equals to the police department asks roy to plan this operation so roy has to tell them the number of officers to recruit and the routes these officers should take in order to catch all the criminals roy has to provide this information while minimizing the total expenses of this operation find out the minimum amount of money required to complete the operation

superman has been invited to india to celebrate diwali unfortunately on his arrival he learns that he has been invited mainly to help rescue people from a fire accident that has happened in a posh residential locale of new delhi where rescue is proving to be especially difficult as he reaches the place of the fire before him there are buildings each of the same height which are on fire since it is diwali some floors of the buildings are empty as the occupants have gone elsewhere for celebrations in his hurry to start the rescue superman reaches the top of the building but realizes that his jumping power is depleted and restricted due to change in his geographical setting he soon understands the restrictions of his jumping power and they are as follows he can use the jumping power any number of times until he reaches the bottom floor which means he can use the jumping power only until before he reaches the bottom ground floor which means once he reaches the bottom floor he cannot move to the top floor again and try to save people in one single drop from the top to bottom while switching buildings he loses height while jumping the second restriction is explained below with an example assume now superman is in the nd building th floor if he wants to switch to the fifth building he will lose height which means he will be at floor at building he can jump freely from the current floor to the floor below on the same building that is suppose if he is at he can go to without any restrictions he cannot skip a floor while jumping in the same building he can go to the floor below the current floor of the same building or use his jumping power switch building and lose height given the information about the occupied floors in each of the buildings help superman to determine the maximum number of people he can save in one single drop from the top to the bottom floor with the given restrictions
