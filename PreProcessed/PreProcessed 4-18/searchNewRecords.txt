Consider a matrix with  rows and  columns, where each cell contains either a  or a  and any cell containing a  is called a filled cell. Two cells are said to be connected if they are adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally; in other words, cell  is connected to cells , , , , , , , and , provided that the location exists in the matrix for that .

If one or more filled cells are also connected, they form a region. Note that each cell in a region is connected to at least one other cell in the region but is not necessarily directly connected to all the other cells in the region.

Task 
Given an  matrix, find and print the number of cells in the largest region in the matrix. Note that there may be more than one region in the matrix.

Numeros, the Artist, had two lists  and , such that  was a permutation of . Numeros was very proud of these lists. Unfortunately, while transporting them from one exhibition to another, some numbers were left out of . Can you find the missing numbers?

Notes

If a number occurs multiple times in the lists, you must ensure that the frequency of that number in both lists is the same. If that is not the case, then it is also a missing number.

You have a long list of tasks that you need to do today. To accomplish task  you need  minutes, and the deadline for this task is . You need not complete a task at a stretch. You can complete a part of it, switch to another task, and then switch back.

You've realized that it might not be possible to complete all the tasks by their deadline. So you decide to do them in such a manner that the maximum amount by which a task's completion time overshoots its deadline is minimized.

There are  bikers present in a city (shaped as a grid) having  bikes. All the bikers want to participate in the HackerRace competition, but unfortunately only  bikers can be accommodated in the race. Jack is organizing the HackerRace and wants to start the race as soon as possible. He can instruct any biker to move towards any bike in the city. In order to minimize the time to start the race, Jack instructs the bikers in such a way that the first  bikes are acquired in the minimum time.

Every biker moves with a unit speed and one bike can be acquired by only one biker. A biker can proceed in any direction. Consider distance between bikes and bikers as Euclidean distance.

Jack would like to know the square of required time to start the race as soon as possible.

The Tower of Hanoi is a famous game consisting of  rods and a number of discs of incrementally different diameters. The puzzle starts with the discs neatly stacked on one rod, ordered by ascending size with the smallest disc at the top. The game's objective is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:

Only one disc can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the topmost disc from a stack and moving it to the top of another stack.
No disc may be placed on top of a smaller disc.
Gena has a modified version of the Tower of Hanoi. His Hanoi has  rods and  discs ordered by ascending size. He made a few moves (following the rules above), but stopped and lost his place. He wants to restore the tower to its original state by making valid moves. Given the state of Gena's Hanoi, help him calculate the minimum number of moves needed to restore the tower to its original state.

Note: Gena's rods are numbered from  to . All discs are initially located on rod .

Karl loves playing games on social networking sites. His current favorite is CandyMaker, where the goal is to make candies.

Karl just started level , in which he must make  candies using  machines and  workers. In a single pass, he can make  candies; after each pass, he can decide whether to spend some of his candies to buy more machines or hire more workers. Buying a machine or hiring a worker costs  units of candies, and there is no limit to the number of machines he can build or workers he can hire.

Karl wants to maximize his score by making all  candies in a minimum number of passes. Can you find and print the minimum number of passes required for Karl to make at least  units of candies?

Ron and Hermione are deep in the Forbidden Forest collecting potion ingredients, and they've managed to lose their way. The path out of the forest is blocked, so they must make their way to a portkey that will transport them back to Hogwarts.

Consider the forest as an  grid. Each cell is either empty (represented by .) or blocked by a tree (represented by ). Ron and Hermione can move (together inside a single cell) LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN through empty cells, but they cannot travel through a tree cell. Their starting cell is marked with the character , and the cell with the portkey is marked with a . The upper-left corner is indexed as .
In example above, Ron and Hermione are located at index  and the portkey is at . Each cell is indexed according to Matrix Conventions

Hermione decides it's time to find the portkey and leave. Each time they are able to move in more than one direction, she waves her wand and it points to the correct direction. Ron is betting that she will have to wave her wand exactly  times. Can you determine if Ron's guesses are correct?

Note: It is guaranteed that there is only one path from the starting location to the portkey.

King Richard is leading a troop of  knights into battle! Being very organized, he labels his knights  and arranges them in an  square formation, demonstrated below:
Before the battle begins, he wants to test how well his knights follow instructions. He issues  drill commands, where each command follows the format ai bi di and is executed like so:

All knights in the square having the top-left corner at location  and the bottom-right corner at location  rotate  in the clockwise direction. Recall that some location  denotes the cell located at the intersection of row  and column .
You must follow the commands sequentially. The square for each command is completely contained within the square for the previous command. Assume all knights follow the commands perfectly.

After performing all  drill commands, it's time for battle! King Richard chooses knights  for his first wave of attack; however, because the knights were reordered by the drill commands, he's not sure where his chosen knights are!

As his second-in-command, you must find the locations of the knights. For each knight , , print the knight's row and column locations as two space-separated values on a new line.
