according to the wikipedia's article the game of life also known simply as life is a cellular automaton devised by the british mathematician john horton conway in given a board with m by n cells each cell has an initial state live or dead each cell interacts with its eight neighbors horizontal vertical diagonal using the following four rules taken from the above wikipedia article any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under population any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies as if by over population any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell as if by reproduction write a function to compute the next state after one update of the board given its current state follow up could you solve it in place remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time you cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells in this question we represent the board using a d array in principle the board is infinite which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array how would you address these problems credits special thanks to jianchao li fighter for adding this problem and creating all test cases

given an array of citations each citation is a non negative integer of a researcher write a function to compute the researcher's h index according to the definition of h index on wikipedia a scientist has index h if h of his her n papers have at least h citations each and the other n − h papers have no more than h citations each for example given citations which means the researcher has papers in total and each of them had received citations respectively since the researcher has papers with at least citations each and the remaining two with no more than citations each his h index is note if there are several possible values for h the maximum one is taken as the h index an easy approach is to sort the array first what are the possible values of h index a faster approach is to use extra space credits special thanks to jianchao li fighter for adding this problem and creating all test cases
