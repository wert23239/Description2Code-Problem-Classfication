you are playing the following bulls and cows game with your friend you write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is each time your friend makes a guess you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position called bulls and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position called cows your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number for example secret number friend s guess hint bull and cows the bull is the cows are and write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend s guess use a to indicate the bulls and b to indicate the cows in the above example your function should return a b please note that both secret number and friend s guess may contain duplicate digits for example secret number friend s guess in this case the st in friend s guess is a bull the nd or rd is a cow and your function should return a b you may assume that the secret number and your friend s guess only contain digits and their lengths are always equal credits special thanks to jeantimex for adding this problem and creating all test cases
given an array of words and a length l format the text such that each line has exactly l characters and is fully left and right justified you should pack your words in a greedy approach that is pack as many words as you can in each line pad extra spaces when necessary so that each line has exactly l characters extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible if the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right for the last line of text it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words for example words this is an example of text justification l return the formatted lines as this is an example of text justification note each word is guaranteed not to exceed l in length click to show corner cases corner cases a line other than the last line might contain only one word what should you do in this case in this case that line should be left justified

implement the following operations of a stack using queues push x push element x onto stack pop removes the element on top of the stack top get the top element empty return whether the stack is empty notes you must use only standard operations of a queue which means only push to back peek pop from front size and is empty operations are valid depending on your language queue may not be supported natively you may simulate a queue by using a list or deque double ended queue as long as you use only standard operations of a queue you may assume that all operations are valid for example no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack credits special thanks to jianchao li fighter for adding this problem and all test cases

serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree there is no restriction on how your serialization deserialization algorithm should work you just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure the encoded string should be as compact as possible note do not use class member global static variables to store states your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless
