As it turned out, one of the very best application areas for machine learning
for many years was computer vision, though it still required a great deal of
hand-coding to get the job done. People would go in and write hand-coded classifiers
like edge detection filters so the program could identify where an object started and stopped;
shape detection to determine if it had eight sides; a classifier to recognize the letters "S-T-O-P."
From all those hand-coded classifiers they would develop algorithms to make sense of the image
and "learn" to determine whether it was a stop sign.

Good, but not mind-bendingly great. Especially on a foggy day when the sign isn't perfectly
visible, or a tree obscures part of it. There's a reason computer vision and image detection
didn't come close to rivaling humans until very recently, it was too brittle and too prone to error.
