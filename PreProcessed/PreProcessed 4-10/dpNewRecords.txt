Christy is interning at HackerRank. One day she has to distribute some chocolates to her colleagues. She is biased towards her friends and may have distributed the chocolates unequally. One of the program managers gets to know this and orders Christy to make sure everyone gets equal number of chocolates.

But to make things difficult for the intern, she is ordered to equalize the number of chocolates for every colleague in the following manner,

For every operation, she can choose one of her colleagues and can do one of the three things.

She can give one chocolate to every colleague other than chosen one.
She can give two chocolates to every colleague other than chosen one.
She can give five chocolates to every colleague other than chosen one.
Calculate minimum number of such operations needed to ensure that every colleague has the same number of chocolates.

Let's talk about binary numbers. We have an -digit binary number, , and we denote the digit at index  (zero-indexed from right to left) to be . We can find the decimal value of  using the following formula:

For example, if binary number , we compute its decimal value like so:

Meanwhile, in our well-known decimal number system where each digit ranges from  to , the value of some decimal number, , can be expanded in the same way:

Now that we've discussed both systems, let's combine decimal and binary numbers in a new system we call decibinary! In this number system, each digit ranges from  to  (like the decimal number system), but the place value of each digit corresponds to the one in the binary number system! For example, the decibinary number  represents the decimal number because:

Pretty cool system, right? Unfortunately, there's a problem; two different decibinary numbers could evaluate to the same decimal value! For example, the decibinary number  also evaluates to the decimal value :

This is a major problem because our new number system has no real applications beyond this challenge!

Consider an infinite list of non-negative decibinary numbers that is sorted according to the following rules:

The decibinary numbers are sorted in increasing order of the decimal value that they evaluate to.
Any two decibinary numbers that evaluate to the same decimal value are ordered by increasing decimal value, meaning the equivalent decibinary values are strictly interpreted and compared as decimal values and the smaller decimal value is ordered first. For example,  and  both evaluate to . We would order  before  because .

Superman has been invited to India to celebrate Diwali. Unfortunately, on his arrival he learns that he has been invited mainly to help rescue people from a fire accident that has happened in a posh residential locale of New Delhi, where rescue is proving to be especially difficult. As he reaches the place of the fire, before him there are  buildings, each of the same height , which are on fire. Since it is Diwali, some floors of the buildings are empty as the occupants have gone elsewhere for celebrations. In his hurry to start the rescue Superman reaches the top of the building, but realizes that his jumping power is depleted and restricted due to change in his geographical setting. He soon understands the restrictions of his jumping power, and they are as follows:

He can use the jumping power any number of times until he reaches the bottom floor, which means he can use the jumping power only until before he reaches the bottom (Ground floor), which means, once he reaches the bottom floor, he cannot move to the top floor again and try to save people. (In one single drop from the top to bottom)

While switching buildings, he loses height  while jumping.

The second restriction is explained below with an example.

Assume . Now Superman is in the 2nd building 5th floor (, ). If he wants to switch to the fifth building (), he will lose height (), which means he will be at floor 3 at building 5 (, ). He can jump freely from the current floor to the floor below on the same building . That is, suppose if he is at , he can go to  without any restrictions. He cannot skip a floor while jumping in the same building. He can go to the floor below the current floor of the same building or use his jumping power, switch building, and lose height .

Given the information about the occupied floors in each of the  buildings, help Superman to determine the maximum number of people he can save in one single drop from the top to the bottom floor with the given restrictions.

Byteland has  cities (numbered from  to ) and  bidirectional roads. A path is comprised of  or more connected roads. It is guaranteed that there is a path from any city to any other city.

Steven is a road maintenance worker in Byteland. He is required to maintain exactly  paths on any given workday. He cannot work on the same road twice in one day (so no  paths can contain the same  roads). Steven can start his workday in any city and, once he has finished maintaining a path, teleport to his next starting city.

Given , help Steven determine how many different possible path sets will allow him to perform his maintenance duties. Then print the answer modulo .

vMr. Road Runner bought a piece of land in the middle of a desert for a nominal amount. It turns out that the piece of land is now worth millions of dollars as it has an oil reserve under it. Mr. Road Runner contacts the ACME corp to set up the oil wells on his land. Setting up oil wells is a costly affair and the charges of setting up oil wells are as follows.

The rectangular plot bought by Mr. Road Runner is divided into r * c blocks. Only some blocks are suitable for setting up the oil well and these blocks have been marked. ACME charges nothing for building the first oil well. For every subsequent oil well built, the cost would be the maximum ACME distance between the new oil well and the existing oil wells.

If (x,y) is the position of the block where a new oil well is setup and (x1, y1) is the position of the block of an existing oil well, the ACME distance is given by

max(|x-x1|, |y-y1|)
the maximum ACME distance is the maximum among all the ACME distance between existing oil wells and new wells.

If the distance of any two adjacent blocks (horizontal or vertical) is considered 1 unit, what is the minimum cost (E) in units it takes to set up oil wells across all the marked blocks?

You are playing a game of Nim with a friend. The rules are are follows:

1) Initially, there are N piles of stones. Two players play alternately.

2) In each turn, a player can choose one non empty pile and remove any number of stones from it. At least one stone must be removed.

3) The player who picks the last stone from the last non empty pile wins the game.

It is currently your friend's turn. You suddenly realize that if your friend was to play optimally in that position, you would lose the game. So while he is not looking, you decide to cheat and add some (possibly 0) stones to each pile. You want the resultant position to be such that your friend has no guaranteed winning strategy, even if plays optimally. You cannot create a new pile of stones. You can only add stones, and not remove stones from a pile. What is the least number of stones you need to add?

Roy is helping the police department of his city in crime fighting. Today, they informed him about a new planned operation.

Think of the city as a  plane. The road along the -axis is very crime prone, because  criminals live there. No two criminals live at the same position.

To catch these criminals, the police department has to recruit some police officers and give each of them USD  as wages. A police officer can start his operation from any point , drive his car to point  in a straight line, and catch all the criminals who live on this way. The cost of fuel used by the officer's car is equal to the square of the euclidean distance between points  and  (Euclidean distance between points  and  equals to  ).

The police department asks Roy to plan this operation. So Roy has to tell them the number of officers to recruit and the routes these officers should take in order to catch all the criminals. Roy has to provide this information while minimizing the total expenses of this operation.

Find out the minimum amount of money required to complete the operation.

There are  pairs of hard disk drives (HDDs) in a cluster. Each HDD is located at an integer coordinate on an infinite straight line, and each pair consists of one primary HDD and one backup HDD.

Next, you want to place  computers at integer coordinates on the same infinite straight line. Each pair of HDDs must then be connected to a single computer via wires, but a computer can have any number (even zero) of HDDs connected to it. The length of a wire connecting a single HDD to a computer is the absolute value of the distance between their respective coordinates on the infinite line. We consider the total length of wire used to connect all the HDDs to computers to be the sum of the lengths of all the wires used to connect HDDs to computers. Note that both the primary and secondary HDDs in a pair must connect to the same computer.

Given the locations of  pairs (i.e., primary and backup) of HDDs and the value of , place all  computers in such a way that the total length of wire needed to connect each pair of HDDs to computers is minimal. Then print the total length on a new line.
