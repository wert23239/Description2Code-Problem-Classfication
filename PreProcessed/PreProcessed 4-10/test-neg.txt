there are pairs of hard disk drives hdds in a cluster each hdd is located at an integer coordinate on an infinite straight line and each pair consists of one primary hdd and one backup hdd next you want to place computers at integer coordinates on the same infinite straight line each pair of hdds must then be connected to a single computer via wires but a computer can have any number even zero of hdds connected to it the length of a wire connecting a single hdd to a computer is the absolute value of the distance between their respective coordinates on the infinite line we consider the total length of wire used to connect all the hdds to computers to be the sum of the lengths of all the wires used to connect hdds to computers note that both the primary and secondary hdds in a pair must connect to the same computer given the locations of pairs i e primary and backup of hdds and the value of place all computers in such a way that the total length of wire needed to connect each pair of hdds to computers is minimal then print the total length on a new line

let s play fairy chess you have an chessboard an leaper is a chess piece which can move from some square to some square if however its movements are restricted to up down left and right within the confines of the chessboard meaning that diagonal moves are not allowed in addition the leaper cannot leap to any square that is occupied by a pawn given the layout of the chessboard can you determine the number of ways a leaper can move times within the chessboard    
say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i design an algorithm to find the maximum profit you may complete as many transactions as you like ie buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times with the following restrictions you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time ie you must sell the stock before you buy again after you sell your stock you cannot buy stock on next day ie cooldown day example prices maxprofit transactions buy sell cooldown buy sell credits special thanks to dietpepsi for adding this problem and creating all test cases
